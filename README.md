# Finding Optimal Deterministic Policies for CSSPs

This repository will be the home of the source code of the i2-dual-det algorithm, our implementation of LAny, and the benchmarks used in our experiments. 
The associated publication is: "Johannes Schmalz and Felipe Trevizan. 2024. Finding Optimal Deterministic Policies for Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path Problems. In Proc. of 27th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)"

This repository will be populated soon. If you want access to the source code, benchmarks, or experimental data sooner please contact the authors.
